# DungeonGame

This is my fun project to finish what I started with C when I was 14. My goal at the time was to build a simple text dungeon game. I didn't really understand OOP at the time, so that didn't go too far, but now I am learning about OOP through my C# courses on Udemy. I thought this would be a great way to do something fun while watching TV at night while also building my programming skills.

Stack used:

C#, Visual Studio

Programming skills used:

Loops, conditionals, variables, logic, encapsulation, classes, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces
